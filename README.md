# Mouse-tracking study

This experiment uses mouse-tracking to examine how people pay attention to different features of a stimulus as they learn. 

## The Task

If you’re interested, you can try out the experiment [here](https://c3inrfidji.cognition.run/) (just enter a random number when prompted for your “SONA ID” – and don’t worry, I won’t be using your data for anything!). 

In this task, participants sort amoeba images into two categories. These amoeba have three features (three different organelles), which the learner reveals by moving their mouse around on the screen. 

Early in the experiment, the learner only needs to pay attention to one of these features to correctly categorize the stimuli, but after they’ve mastered the task, I introduce “exceptions” that effectively ruin this rule. To correctly categorize exceptions, the learner must now pay attention to all of the stimulus dimensions. 

Critically, this experiment has two conditions: one where the exceptions look very similar to the original amoeba, and another where they are very different. I was interested in whether this degree of overlap between the rule-following amoeba and exceptions might influence attention and subsequent learning. 

## The analysis

Analysis files for the two conditions are included in this repository as “[analysis_3-1.nb.html]([url](https://rawcdn.githack.com/emheffernan/mousetracking_study/ee86dbf42f70bfe92cca400e0083582cb0ec2336/analysis_3_1.nb.html))” and “[analysis_3-2.nb.html]([url](https://rawcdn.githack.com/emheffernan/mousetracking_study/ee86dbf42f70bfe92cca400e0083582cb0ec2336/analysis_3_2.nb.html))” (clicking either of these links will let you view the rendered html file). Here I assess accuracy (how well participants learned) and mouse-tracking data (which stimulus features were participants looking at throughout the experiment?). 

## The results

(Very) briefly, I find that the most successful learners are the ones who rapidly expand their attention to consider new features when the exceptions are introduced. However, this is only true when exceptions look very similar to rule-followers. These data suggest that surprising information (that goes against what we previously learned) influences our attention and subsequent learning, but the level of surprise is important.
